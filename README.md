# Cornell scintillation model (CSM)

This repository contains the CSM, which was developed by Humphreys et. al. in [1] and further developed in [2, 3]. This repository contains the nonmodified CSM, which was provided [official website](https://gps.ece.cornell.edu/tools.php) under the name "GPS L1 C/A Scintillation Simulation Toolkit".
